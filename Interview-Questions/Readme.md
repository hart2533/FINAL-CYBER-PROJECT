# Domain Specific Interview Questions

## Instructions

The work you did on this project cuts across a wide range of topics: network security logging and monitoring, offensive and defensive security.

When networking and talking to potential employers, you should know how to discuss the work you did on your project to address specific interview questions or to show your skills within a specific domain. This section will teach you how to do this.

First, you will choose a domain that you are interested in pursuing as a career. For this project, you will choose from among the following domains:


- Network Security


- Logging & Monitoring


- Offensive Security


- Defensive Security: Incident Response Phases I & II


If you are unsure of which domain you would like to focus on, that's ok! You can either choose the one that you are the most comfortable discussing, or you can also complete the tasks in two or three domains.

For each domain, you will be provided a set of interview questions.  For each question, you will be prompted to think about specific aspects or tasks you completed in Project 3 that you can use to answer the question.
In this section, you will:


- Select one domain and one question.


- Write a one-page response that answers the question using specific examples from your work on Project 3. Your response should flow and read like a presentation while still keeping the general structure of the technical question response guidelines. 


A good response includes the following: 


- Restate the Problem


- Provide a Concrete Example Scenario


- Explain the Solution Requirements


- Explain the Solution Details


- Identify Advantages/Disadvantages of the Solution​


Including each of these components will ensure you provide the interviewer with proof of competency of subject matter and critical thinking. 
Submission Guidelines​: You will submit your one-page response. At the end of the project, you will have the opportunity to present your answer if desired.
